   * //            "Introduction": "Patellofemoral Syndrome, also known as Chondromalacia Patella, is a condition characterized by the softening or irregularity of the articular cartilage of the patella and femur, leading to increased friction and pain in the knee joint. This condition is often aggravated by activities that involve deep knee bending, jumping, or heavy load-bearing.",
   * //            "Body": "The symptoms of Patellofemoral Syndrome include pain in the front of the knee, especially when going up and down stairs, sitting for long periods with bent knees, or performing deep knee bends. The condition is exacerbated by activities that place high stress on the patellofemoral joint, such as running, jumping, and certain sports. Treatment primarily involves avoiding activities that compress the patella against the femur, using knee supports, applying ice packs, and taking anti-inflammatory medications.",
   * //            "Conclusion": "Effective management of Patellofemoral Syndrome includes a combination of activity modification, supportive devices, and specific exercises. Exercises that do not cause pain, grinding, or swelling are recommended, such as straight-leg lifts, stationary cycling, and hamstring curls. Stretching exercises for the hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and lateral hip and thigh are also beneficial. Following a structured exercise program as instructed by a healthcare professional can help alleviate symptoms and improve knee function."
