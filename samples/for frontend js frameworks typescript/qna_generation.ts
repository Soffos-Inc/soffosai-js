    needs to be done or money that need to be spent to keep their NLP at a state where it \

    complex logic, for developers to use out-of-the-box, as is, removing the need to develop \
    it themselves. Moreover, Soffos continuously updates their modules to match the state of \
    the art. Developers will never need to maintain any AI/NLP related component of their \

    however they desire to come up with amazing intelligent applications."
